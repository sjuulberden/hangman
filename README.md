## Hangman - the evil version - version 1.1 (02-06-2014)

In the game of hangman the computer plays against a user. The user will try to guess the word chosen by the
computer. For guessing the user gets seven chances, if he didn't guess the word at the end of the game he will be hung! 
However in the game the computer can be evil! This means that he can change the word, without the user noticing this! Are you able to beat the evil computer?
